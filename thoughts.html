            <h2>The Death and Life of Great American Cities</h2>
            <p>
                I read the book <cite>The Death and Life of Great American Cities</cite> by Jane Jacobs this summer. It is a groundbreaking work that challenges conventional urban planning principles and celebrates the complexity of city life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jacobs critiques the top-down planning approaches that prioritize large-scale development and segregation of uses, advocating instead for the organic, diverse, and mixed-use neighborhoods that foster vibrant communities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Her emphasis on the importance of street life has reshaped how we understand what makes cities livable and safe. Reflecting on Jacobsâ€™ insights, it's clear how vital it is to prioritize human experience in urban design, ensuring cities remain dynamic, inclusive, and resilient environments where people can truly thrive.
