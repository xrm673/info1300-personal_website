            <h2>Healthy Streets for Beijing</h2>
            <p>
                Working with the <strong>Beijing Municipal Institute of City Planning and Design (BMICPD)</strong>, I conducted an on-site survey to analyze the current conditions of Chaowai Street and evaluated the street using the Healthy Street framework from London, identifying 11 key areas for improvement.
            </p>
            <p>
                Leveraging tools like AutoCAD and SketchUp, I developed a revised street model that was ultimately adopted in the street's reconstruction, contributing to the enhancement of urban design and public health in the area.

            <h2>Spatial Analysis for Atlanta</h2>
            <p>
                In my project, <cite>Concrete Barriers: How Atlanta's Expressway Shaped Division</cite>, I conducted a GIS analysis to examine the impact of expressways on Atlanta's urban landscape and local communities.
            </p>
            <p>
                By utilizing census data, I contrasted the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics—such as income, race, and business presence—of neighborhoods on either side of the expressways.
            </p>
            <p>
                This analysis highlighted how these infrastructures contribute to segregation and economic disparities, revealing the profound role expressways play in shaping the city's development and social fabric.
            </p>
